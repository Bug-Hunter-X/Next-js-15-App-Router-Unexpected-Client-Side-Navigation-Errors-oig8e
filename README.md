# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Client-Side Navigation Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js 15 applications using the app router. Client-side navigation, particularly with dynamic routes or nested layouts, can lead to unexpected errors.  The error messages aren't always helpful, making debugging challenging. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` shows a simple component with links.  Depending on the application structure and route configuration, navigating between these links might result in unexpected behavior or errors like 404s or other client-side JavaScript failures.  The error messages are usually not descriptive enough to pinpoint the cause easily.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` (if available) may offer a way to handle dynamic routes, optimize navigation, or use middleware to address the root cause of the unexpected errors. Possible solutions might include:

* Improved route handling using `next/navigation`
* Correctly defining dynamic segments in your routes
* Implementing error handling and fallback routes.
* Using middleware to handle some routes before they're rendered.

This is a general issue that may require specific solutions tailored to each application. The solution provided may or may not be applicable to all scenarios.
